## Our Expectations
Positive behaviors that contribute to a harmonious community atmosphere include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
* Respecting diverse opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, or making sexual advances
* Engaging in trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, or launching personal or political attacks

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers bear the responsibility of defining and upholding the standards of acceptable conduct. They will respond appropriately and fairly to instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the authority and duty to remove, modify, or decline comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently prohibit any contributor for behaviors they judge as inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct is applicable within all community spaces and extends to situations where an individual officially represents the community in public forums.
