            There is no Frigate like a Book
            To take us Lands away
            Nor any Coursers like a Page
            Of prancing Poetry –
            This Traverse may the poorest take
            Without oppress of Toll –
            How frugal is the Chariot
            That bears the Human Soul –
                        ~<i>Emily Dickinson</i>

            <h2><u>The Red Wheelbarrow</u></h2>
            so much depends
            upon
            
            a red wheel
            barrow
            
            glazed with rain
            water
            
            beside the white
            chickens
                    ~<i>William Carlos Williams</i>

            <h2><u>Poem</u></h2>
            The night is beautiful,
            So the faces of my people.
            
            The stars are beautiful,
            So the eyes of my people.
            
            Beautiful, also, is the sun
            Beautiful, also, are the souls of my people.
                                    ~<i>Langston Hughes</i>

            <h2><u>To an Icicle</u></h2>
            Chilled into a serenity
            As rigid as your pose
            You linger trustingly,
            But a gutter waits for you.
            Your elegance does not secure
            You favors with the sun.
            He is not one to pity fragileness.
            He thinks all cheeks should burn
            And feel how tears can run.
                                ~<i>Blanche Taylor Dickinson</i>
